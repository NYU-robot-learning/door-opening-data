# Door Opening Dataset

This is a repository containing door opening data using modified reacher-grabber stick with iPhone mounted on it. This data was used in works **FISH**: [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01497) [[Project page and videos]](https://fast-imitation.github.io/) and **VINN**: [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01511) [[Project page and videos]](https://jyopari.github.io/VINN/)
